# 911 Calls Capstone Project

## Project Overview

For this capstone project, we analyze 911 emergency call data to gain insights into call volumes, reasons for calls, and temporal patterns. The project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and various data visualization libraries.

## Project Description

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle containing emergency call information, including details such as the type of emergency, location coordinates, and timestamps. The goals of this project include:

- Analyzing trends and patterns in emergency call data.
- Visualizing call volumes over time, by location, and by type of emergency.
- Exploring correlations and insights to aid emergency response planning.

## Data source
The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle's 911 Calls dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert). It includes information such as:
- Latitude and longitude of the emergency call
- Description of the emergency
- Zip code and township of the emergency location
- Timestamp of the call
- Type of emergency (e.g., EMS, Fire, Traffic)
- 
## Installation
**Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/simhayn/emergency-calls.git
    cd emergency-calls
    ```
## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook for data analysis:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook notebooks/911_calls_analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Features
- Data Loading and Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze call volumes, trends, and geographical distribution.
- Visualization: Use matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for visualizing emergency call data.
- Insights: Gain insights to aid emergency response planning.
